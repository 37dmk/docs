# Pricing

We want you to create pipelines and test new ideas without worrying about an unexpected bill. For now, **Pipedream is free**, subject to the following constraints:

- All data is private, always, but notebooks you author are made public as soon as you save them.
- Your pipelines run within our [limits](/limits/).
- You follow our [Acceptable Use](https://pipedream.com/terms/#b-acceptable-use) policy. In short this means: don't use Pipedream to break the law; don't abuse the platform; and don't use the platform to harm others.

If you're hitting limits on our free tier, or have any questions, please [reach out](/support/).
