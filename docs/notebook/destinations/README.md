## Adding a new Destination

You can add a new **Destination** cell in one of two ways.

First, you can click on the **+** button under any existing cell, and choose the **Destination** cell type:

<div>
<img alt="Add a new cell" width="171" src="./images/new-cell.png">
</div>

Or, on new notebooks, we provide buttons to add new cells quickly without having to dig into the **+** menu:

<div>
<img alt="New destination button" width="262" src="./images/new-destination.png">
</div>

After selecting the **Destination** cell type, you'll be asked to choose your destination type. Click on one of the available options.

<div>
<img alt="New destination type" src="./images/new-destination-type.png">
</div>

Note that your list of destinations may look different than the screenshot above. We're constantly adding new destinations to help you route data to wherever you'd like. If we don't support your target destination, please [reach out](/support/) so we can discuss it more!
