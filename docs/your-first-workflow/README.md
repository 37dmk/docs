# Your first workflow

Building your first workflow is the best way to understand how Pipedream works. Best of all, [running workflows is free](/pricing/)!

Visit [our tutorial workflow](https://pipedream.com/@tod/use-http-requests-to-trigger-a-workflow-p_6lCy5y/readme), press the big green **Copy** button to [create a copy](/workflows/copy/) of the workflow in your account, and walk through the overview. It'll only take 3 minutes.

Once you're done with the tutorial, start building workflows to solve your own problems. Get creative and share them with others!

As you build, review the rest of the docs to understand how you can use the platform for more advanced use cases:

- [Steps](/workflows/steps/)
  - [Triggers](/workflows/steps/triggers/)
  - [Code](/workflows/steps/code/)
  - [Actions](/workflows/steps/actions/)
  - [Exporting data from steps](/workflows/steps/#step-exports)
  - [Passing data to steps](/workflows/steps/#passing-data-to-steps-step-parameters)
- [Events](/workflows/events/)
- [Destinations](/destinations/)
- [SQL](/destinations/sql/)
