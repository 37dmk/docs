# Destinations

**Destinations**, like [Actions](/notebook/actions/), abstract the delivery and connection logic required to send events to services like Amazon S3, or targets like HTTP and email.

However, Destinations are different than Actions in two ways:

- **Events are delivered to the Destinations asynchronously**, after your workflow completes. This means you don't wait for network I/O (e.g. for HTTP requests or connection overhead for data warehouses) within your workflow code, so you can process more events faster.
- In the case of data stores like S3 and warehouses like Snowflake, you typically don't want to send every event on its own. This can be costly and confers little benefit. **Instead, you typically want to batch a collection of events together, sending the batch at some frequency. Destinations handle that batching for relevant services**.

The docs below discuss features common to all Destinations. See the [docs for a given destination](#available-destinations) for information specific to those destinations.

## Available Destinations

- [Webhook](/notebook/destinations/http/)
- [Email](/notebook/destinations/email/)
- [S3](/notebook/destinations/s3/)
- [Pipedream Data Warehouse](/notebook/sql/)
- [Snowflake](/notebook/destinations/snowflake/)
- [SSE](/notebook/destinations/sse/)

## Adding a Destination

### Using `$send`

You can send data to Destinations in [Node.js code steps](/notebook/code/), too, using `$send` functions.

`$send` is an object provided by Pipedream that exposes destination-specific functions like `$send.http()`, `$send.s3()`, and more. **This allows you to send data to destinations programmatically, if you need more control than Actions afford**.

Let's use `$send.http()` to send an HTTP POST request like we did in the Action example above. [Add a new Action](/notebook/actions/#adding-a-new-action), then search for "**Code**":

<div>
<img alt="Code action" width="300" src="./images/new-code-step.png">
</div>

[Create an endpoint URL on RequestBin](https://requestbin.com), adding the code below to your code step, with the URL you created:

```javascript
$send.http({
  method: "POST",
  url: "[YOUR URL HERE]",
  data: {
    name: "Luke Skywalker"
  }
});
```

See the docs for the [Webhook destination](/notebook/destinations/http/) to learn more about all the options you can pass to the `$send.http()` function.

Again, it's important to remember that **Destination delivery is asynchronous**. If you iterate over an array of values and send an HTTP request for each:

```javascript
const names = ["Luke", "Han", "Leia", "Obi Wan"];
names.forEach(name => {
  $send.http({
    method: "POST",
    url: "[YOUR URL HERE]",
    data: {
      name
    }
  });
});
```

you won't have to `await` the execution of the HTTP requests in your workflow. We'll collect every `$send.http()` call and defer those HTTP requests, sending them after your workflow finishes.

## Asynchronous Delivery

For every event sent to a workflow, for each Destination you've added, we send the specified payload to the desired Destination.

Events are delivered to Destinations _asynchronously_ â€” that is, separate from the execution of your workflow. **This means you're not waiting for network or connection I/O in the middle of your function, which can be costly**.

Some Destination payloads, like HTTP, are delivered within seconds. For other Destinations, like S3 and SQL, we collect individual events into a batch and send the batch to the Destination. See the [docs for a given Destination](#available-destinations) for the relevant batch delivery frequency.
