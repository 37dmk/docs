# What is Pipedream?

Pipedream is a [free](/pricing/) service for developers to build and run [workflows](/notebook/) that integrate your apps, data, and APIs — no servers or infrastructure to manage!

## What are workflows?

A workflow is a sequence of linear steps that operates on an event.

- Pipedream executes your workflow on every event (e.g., [HTTP requests](/notebook/sources/#webhook-sources) or a [schedule](/cron/))

- Add steps to run Node.js [code](/notebook/code/) and [pre-built actions](/notebook/actions/).

- Steps are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.

- Select events to inspect export values, logs and errors for each step.

- Iterate quickly with npm support, automatic versioning and instant deploys.

- Build in your browser, run on our servers - just sign in to get started.

Workflow code is [public](/public-workflows/) so the community can discover and fork it. Your workflow execution and event data is **private**.

## What can you do with Pipedream?

Here are some templates to get you started:

- [Run a cron job to kick off Node.js code or send an HTTP request](https://pipedream.com/@tod/cron-scheduler-workflow-free-p_mkC5B1/readme)
- [Search Twitter for a keyword, post new tweets to Slack](https://pipedream.com/@pravin/search-twitter-and-post-new-tweets-to-slack-p_dDCq9m/readme)
- [Send an HTTP request to trigger an email](https://pipedream.com/@pravin/send-yourself-an-email-on-http-request-p_ZJCqj9/readme)
- [Process an HTTP request, return a response to the client](https://pipedream.com/@pravin/return-a-response-from-your-workflow-p_zACJqp/readme)
- [Fan out requests to multiple webhooks](https://pipedream.com/@pravin/fan-out-requests-to-multiple-webhooks-p_4wOCrW/edit?collapse=collapse)

In other tools, you typically have to setup infrastructure to process events — typically you setup an HTTP endpoint, then run a script on a container, or have to manage a serverless function. This takes time to write and maintain.

Pipedream is purpose-built for running workflows on event data, so we take care of the infrastructure and boilerplate configuration for you. **Pipedream lets you focus on _what_ you want done, and we take care of _how_ to do it for you.**

## Get started

It takes less than 5 minutes to write your first workflow. [Sign up](/sign-up/) to get started.
