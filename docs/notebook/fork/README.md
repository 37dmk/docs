# Forking a notebook

On Pipedream, a "fork" refers to a copy of an existing notebook. When you find a public notebook that you want to use yourself, you fork it to make a copy of the notebook that lives in your account.

When you find the notebook that you'd like to fork, click the big green **Fork** button near the top-right:

<div>
<img alt="Fork button" src="./images/fork.png">
</div>

If you're not signed into your Pipedream account, or haven't yet signed up, you'll be prompted to.

After forking, you'll now have a copy of the same notebook in your account, ready to activate and send data to.
