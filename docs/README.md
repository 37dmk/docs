# Documentation

Welcome to Pipedream! Our goal is to be the simplest way to develop, execute and maintain event driven code [for free](/pricing/).

These docs provide an overview of how the platform works, from the simplest workflow to the deepest technical details of the service. We hope they answer most of your questions. If not, or if you have any feedback or ideas about the product, please [reach out](/support/). We'd love to hear from you!

If you've got a specific question, use the search box at the top-right of the page to find answers. If you're new to Pipedream, [start here](/what-is-pipedream/).
