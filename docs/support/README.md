# Getting Support

We want to make sure Pipedream helps you to be productive. If you have any questions, feedback, or ideas for how we could improve the platform, you can chat us using the Intercom widget at the bottom-right corner of the app, or here in the docs:

You can also email us at <span style="unicode-bidi:bidi-override; direction: rtl;font-weight: bold">moc.maerdepip@troppus</span> or reach out on [Spectrum](http://spectrum.chat/pipedream). We'd love to hear from you!
