# Pipedream Notebooks

You author Pipedream pipelines as **notebooks**. Notebooks include cells, which you can add, edit and remove interactively, sending new data to your pipeline with each change and viewing the associated observability for simple debugging.

We use the term notebook and pipeline interchangeably in different contexts. We want these docs to be readable, not pedantic and dry. There is, however, a core difference in how we define **notebook** and **pipeline**:

- **Notebook**
- **Pipeline**

The cells of Pipedream notebooks are run in the order they appear in the notebook.
