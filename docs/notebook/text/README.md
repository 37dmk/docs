# Text

You can add optional text cells anywhere in a notebook, allowing you to add comments or descriptions of other steps to help other readers understand your pipeline.

For example, you might want to add a longer description at the top of your pipeline to make it clear what your pipeline does:

<div>
<img alt="Text description" src="./images/text-description.png">
</div>

**Text cells support [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)**, so you can format rich text, adding links, formatting, bulleted lists and more.

Text cells do not affect the execution of code or destinations in a pipeline. They are purely decorative and helpful for readers of your pipeline.
