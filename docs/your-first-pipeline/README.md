# Your first pipeline

Building your first pipeline is the best way to understand how Pipedream works. Best of all, running pipelines is free!

Visit [our tutorial pipeline](https://pipedream.com/@pravin/tutorial-create-your-first-pipeline-in-5-minutes-p_4yKC36?c=c_GafGKB), press the big green **Fork** button at the top-right to [fork](/notebook/fork/) (create a copy of) the pipeline in your account, and walk through the overview. It'll only take 5 minutes.

Once you're done with the tutorial, start building pipelines to solve your own problems. Get creative and share it with others!

As you build, review the rest of the docs to understand how you can use the platform for more advanced use cases:

- [Sources](/notebook/sources/)
- [Inspector](/notebook/inspector/)
- [`$event`](/notebook/dollar-event/)
- [Code](/notebook/code/)
- [Destinations](/notebook/destinations/)
- [Text](/notebook/text/)
- [SQL](/notebook/sql/)
