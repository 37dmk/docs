# Installing the CLI

Pipedream publishes a build of the CLI for macOS and Linux. To install the CLI, run:

```text
curl https://cli.pipedream.com/install | sh
```

Run `pd` to see a list of all commands, or `pd help <command>` to display help docs for a specific command.

The [CLI reference](/cli/reference/) also includes usage for each command, with examples for each.
