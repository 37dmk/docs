# Documentation

Pipedream is a [free](/pricing/) service for developers to build and run [workflows](/notebook/) that integrate your apps, data, and APIs — no servers or infrastructure to manage!

- Pipedream executes your workflow on every event (e.g., [HTTP requests](/notebook/sources/#webhook-sources) or a [schedule](/cron/)).

- Add steps to run Node.js [code](/notebook/code/) and [actions](/notebook/actions/).

- Steps are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.

- Select events to inspect export values, logs and errors for each step.

Workflow code is [public](/public-workflows/) so the community can discover and fork it. Your workflow execution and event data is **private**.

If you have any questions or feedback, [join us on Slack](https://pipedream.com/community/) or [reach out](/support/)!

If you're new to Pipedream, [start here](/what-is-pipedream/).
