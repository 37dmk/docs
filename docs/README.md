# Documentation

Welcome to Pipedream! We want to make it easy for you to ingest, transform and route data.

When you develop pipelines on Pipedream, you focus on how your pipeline should work. We take care of the infrastructure to make that happen.

These docs provide a detailed overview of how the platform works, from the simplest pipeline to the deepest technical details of the service. We hope they answer most of your questions. If not, or if you have any feedback or ideas about the product, please [reach out](/support/). We'd love to hear from you!

If you've got a specific question, you can use the box at the top-right of the page to search for it. If you're new to Pipedream, [start here](/what-is-pipedream/).
