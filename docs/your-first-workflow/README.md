# Your first workflow

Building your first workflow is the best way to understand how Pipedream works. Best of all, running workflow [is free](/pricing/)!

Visit [our tutorial workflow](https://pipedream.com/@tod/use-http-requests-to-trigger-a-workflow-p_6lCy5y/readme), press the big green **Fork** button at the top-right to [fork](/notebook/fork/) (create a copy of) the workflow in your account, and walk through the overview. It'll take 3 minutes.

Once you're done with the tutorial, start building workflows to solve your own problems. Get creative and share it with others!

As you build, review the rest of the docs to understand how you can use the platform for more advanced use cases:

- [Sources](/notebook/sources/)
- [Inspector](/notebook/inspector/)
- [`$event`](/notebook/dollar-event/)
- [Code](/notebook/code/)
- [Destinations](/notebook/destinations/)
- [SQL](/notebook/sql/)

If you've got any questions at all, [reach out](/support/). We're happy to help!
