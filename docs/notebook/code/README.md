# Code

Code cells are optional, but common. If the data received by your source needs no modification, and can be sent directly to a destination, you don't need code cells in a notebook.

But often, you'll want to modify the data you receive in some way. You may need to look up additional metadata about the event, parse raw data into more meaningful fields, or end the execution of a pipeline early under some conditions. Code cells let you do this and more.

## Language Support

Today, Pipedream supports JavaScript, specifically [Node.js v8.10](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.8.10/).

**Anything you can do with JavaScript, you can do in a pipeline**. This includes using most of [npm's 400,000 packages](#using-npm-packages).

We understand the choice of JavaScript as the first supported language for a data pipeline tool may seem odd. But we're enabling any engineer to be a data engineer, and so want to start with one of the [most used](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019#technology-_-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) [languages](https://github.blog/2018-11-15-state-of-the-octoverse-top-programming-languages/), it makes sense.

In 2019, the JavaScript ecosystem continues to grow, and we believe our users will benefit from that.

If you've never used JavaScript, see the [resources below]

## Using `npm` packages

## New to JavaScript?
